# Flutter State Management Crash Course 🚀

This repository is part of the Flutter State Management Crash Course by Rivaan Ranawat. The course covers building three different applications to demonstrate state management using BLoC and Cubit.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **main**: Main branch containing the overall project structure and documentation.
- **counter-app**: Branch specifically for the Counter App with detailed explanations.

## State Management

State management is a crucial aspect of Flutter app development. It involves handling and updating the application's state, ensuring that the user interface reflects the current data and user interactions.

### BLoC (Business Logic Component) 🧠

BLoC is an architectural pattern in Flutter that helps manage the state of an application by separating the business logic from the UI. It uses streams to handle data flow and events, making the code more modular and testable.

### Cubit 📦

Cubit is a lightweight state management solution that simplifies the implementation of BLoC. It is a subset of BLoC, focusing on simplicity and ease of use for smaller applications.

## Branches

### Main Branch

The main branch provides an overview of the project structure and contains this README.md file. It serves as a starting point for exploring the state management concepts in Flutter.

### Counter App Branch

The counter-app branch is dedicated to the Counter App example. In this branch, you will find detailed explanations of BLoC and Cubit usage in the context of a simple counter application.
